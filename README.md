# Project
## Planning
### Idea
Use pre built base from last year to construct a robot arm to work with a raspberry pi. The robot arm will pick up an object; and by turning the knobs, will change where the object will be placed. 
### Materials
- Old Robot Arm Project 
- Raspberry Pi
- Batteries
- Wiring
- Servos
- 3D Printed grabber (thing that picks up the objects)
- Screws
- Bolts
- Led light
### Weekly Milestones
Week 1: Reconstruct base of robot arm.
Week 2: Create new pieces needed to complete the arm.
Week 3: Construct final assembly of robot arm. 
Week 4: Code raspberry pi to move servos according to dials, making robot arm move. 
Week 5: Put raspberry pi and arm together, test if it works, fix any problems. 
Week 6: Finish fixing problems, add finishing touches. 
Week 7: Final project complete.
